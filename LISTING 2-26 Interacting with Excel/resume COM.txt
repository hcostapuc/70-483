The Component Object Model (COM) is a mechanism that allows software components to
interact. 

When a .NET application wants to interact with a COM object it has to perform the following:
1. Convert any parameters for the COM object into an appropriate format
2. Switch to unmanaged execution for the COM behavior
3. Invoke the COM behavior
4. Switch back to managed execution upon completion of the COM behavior
5. Convert any results of the COM request into the correct types of .NET objects


This is performed by a component called the Primary Interop Assembly (PIA) that is supplied along with the COM object. The results returned by the PIA can be managed as dynamic
objects, so that the type of the values can be inferred rather than having to be specified
directly.
