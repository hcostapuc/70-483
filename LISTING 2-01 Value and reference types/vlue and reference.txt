MEMORY ALLOCATION:

Memory to be used to store variables of value type is allocated on the stack. The stack is an
area of memory that is allocated and removed as programs enter and leave blocks. Any value
type variables created during the execution of a block are stored on a local stack frame and
then the entire frame is discarded when the block completes. This is an extremely efficient way
to manage memory.

Memory to be used to store variables of reference type is allocated on a different structure, called the heap. The heap is managed for an entire application. The heap is required
because, as references may be passed between method calls as parameters, it is not the case
that objects managed by reference can be discarded when a method exits. Objects can only
be removed from the heap when the garbage collection process determines that there are no
references to them.
